    "subset A of the sample space Ω is in the event space A if at the end\n",
    "of the experiment we can observe whether a particular outcome ω ∈ Ω\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the capital letters at the end of the alphabet, such as W,X,Y, and Z typically represent the definition of the random variable. The corresponding lowercase letters, such as w,x,y, and z, represent the random variable’s possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## And now what is a Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "By a discrete random variable, it is meant a function (or a mapping), say X, from a sample space Ω, into the set of real numbers. Symbolically, if ω ∈Ω, then X (ω ) = x, where x is a real number.\n",

    "\n",
    "**For a value x of the set of possible outcomes of the random variable X , i.e., x ∈ T , p(x) denotes the probability that random variable X has the outcome x.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For discrete random variables, this is written as P (X = x), which is known as the probability mass function. The pmf is often referred to as the distribution”. For continuous variables, p(x) is called the probability density function (often referred to as a density).**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say probability distribution it may pertain to a discrete random variable or a continuous random variable, depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the random variable is discrete, probability distribution means, how the total probability is distributed over various possible values of the random variable.

    "While for a **discrete random variable** X that takes on a finite or countably infinite number of possible values, we determined P(X=x) for all of the possible values of X, and called it the probability mass function (“p.m.f.”). For **continuous random variables**, the probability that X takes on any particular value x is 0. That is, finding P(X=x) for a continuous random variable X is not going to work. Instead, we’ll need to find the probability that X falls in some interval (a,b), that is, we’ll need to find P(a<X<b). We’ll do that using a probability density function (“p.d.f.”).\n",

This is why the probability for a continuous random variable can be interpreted as an area under the curve on an interval. In other words, we cannot describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable by giving probability of single values of the random variable as we did for a discrete random variable.

    "In the case of of continuous random variable, we should not ask for the probability that **_X_** is exactly a single number (since that probability is zero). Instead, we need to think about the probability that **x** is close to a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We capture the notion of being close to a number with a _probability density function_ which is normally denoted by **P(_x_)**. If the probability density around a point **x** is large, that means the random variable **X** is likely to be close to **_x_**. If, on the other hand, **P(_x_)=0** in some interval, then **_X_** won’t be in that interval.\n",

    "Let’s assume **d𝒙** is infinitesimally small with a value of 0.00000000001.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the probability that **X** will fall in **\\[𝒙, 𝒙+d𝒙\\]** is the **Area** under the curve **f(𝒙)** sandwiched by **\\[𝒙, 𝒙+d𝒙\\]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Area Under a Curve — Integral Calculus Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under a curve between two points can be found by doing a definite integral between the two points. To find the area under the curve y = f(x) between x = a and x = b, integrate y = f(x) between the limits of a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "To translate the probability density P(x) into a probability, imagine that _Ix_ is some small interval around the point x. Then, assuming P is continuous, the probability that _X_ is in that interval will depend both on the density P(_x_) and the length of the interval\n",
    "\n",
    "P ( _X_ ∈ _Ix_) ≈ P (_x_) × Length of _Ix_\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t have a true equality here, because the density P may vary over the interval Ix. But, the approximation becomes better and better as the interval Ix shrinks around the point x, as P will be come closer and closer to a constant inside that small interval. The probability P ( X ∈ Ix ) approaches zero as Ix shrinks down to an infinitesemally small value to the point x (consistent with our above result for single numbers), but the information about X is contained in the rate that this probability goes to zero as Ix shrinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to determine the probability that X is in any subset A of the real numbers, we simply add up the values of P(x) in the subset. By “add up,” we mean integrate the function P(x) over the set A.\n",
